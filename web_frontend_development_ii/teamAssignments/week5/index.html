    Instructions:
  </h1>
  <pre>
    Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/Netozao/netozao.github.io/blob/master/web_frontend_development_ii/teamAssignments/week5/hiking.html">this</a> code. This basic html is linked to a js file (hiking-start.js), which is an example of a small application that takes some data, and builds out the HTML necessary to display it in the browser.
    Since this is a small app we can get away with it, but if it were larger and more complex it could quickly become hard to follow.
    As complexity increases, we need a better solution.
