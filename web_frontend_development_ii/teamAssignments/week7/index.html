  <h2>Instructions:</h2>
  <pre>
    To improve the site from week 5, do the following:

      A getAllComments and renderCommentList method.
      A comment type to use as a key.
      A filterCommentsByName method.
      An array to hold all of our comments.
      A comment should look something like this:
          const newComment = {
          name: hikeName,
          date: new Date(),
          content: comment
          };
      A method to add an event listener to the submit button.
      An addComment method
      Create a new module for our Comments code. 
      Create a class with a constructor to act as the controller. 
      The constructor should set a local property called type when the class is instantiated.
      Insert your comment class into the hike class by adding a new instance of the comment class in the constructor. 
      Call the showCommentsList method when the list of hikes is shown to make sure that you have things connected up correctly.
      When you are looking at a specific hike it should allow you to enter a new comment, and should show all the comments below that form.
      Write the rest of the code to implement your commenting system. For now just store your comments in an array.
      Write the model code to store and retrieve the comments to/from local storage.
